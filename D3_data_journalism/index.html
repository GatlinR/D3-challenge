          <h2>Findings on How Age and Income Affect Likelihood of Smoking</h2>
          <p>The median age of citizens living in a state is listed in correlation to the percentage of smokers in that state.
            The younger a state's population is seems to infer less smokers residing there.</p>
          <p>Annual Household Income appears to be an excellent indicator of identifying smokers.
             States with low household incomes have a higher percentage of smokers. States with higher 
             household incomes tend to be less likely to smoke.</p>
          <p>Comparing those living in poverty also reinforces the assumption above that infers that those who 
            bring in less income are more likely to be smokers. The higher a state has citizens living in poverty, the more 
            smokers they have residing in their state.</p>
